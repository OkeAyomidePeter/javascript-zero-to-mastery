# JavaScript Zero to Mastery (Progressing into TypeScript)

This repository contains 100 progressively challenging JavaScript projects. The goal is to help learners move beyond passive tutorials and build practical software with real-world patterns. Each project is organized in its own numbered folder and includes a detailed `README.md` for clarity.

The first phase uses JavaScript to build fundamentals: variables, control flow, functions, DOM interaction, asynchronous programming, and simple data structures. Later projects transition into TypeScript to introduce typing, interfaces, generics, and compile-time safety. This shift reflects how modern production environments evolve.

All code in this repository is thoroughly commented and annotated to support problem-solving over memorization. The intent is to teach practical thinking, encourage exploration, and help break out of “tutorial hell” by showing how real projects are structured and improved.

Video walkthroughs may be added when a project benefits from visual explanation or maps cleanly to real-world use cases.

## Roadmap

- Add optional video walkthroughs for complex projects
- Demonstrate TypeScript tooling and build pipelines
- Introduce testing coverage demonstrations
- Add prompts for self-reflection after each build

## Goals

- Build by doing, not watching
- Understand JavaScript fundamentals before typing systems
- Develop confidence in reading, writing, and refactoring code
- Learn how static typing reduces bugs at scale
- Gain technical range from simple scripts to full applications

Move forward only when the concepts feel comfortable. Consistency matters more than speed.
